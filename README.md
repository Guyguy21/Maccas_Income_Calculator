# Maccas_Income_Calculator
Personal project from 2019, for calculating my income and PAYG taxes ahead of time. Most certainly irrelevant today

This project was written specifically for a 19-year old casual worker at Maccas under the McDonalds Australia Enterprise Agreement 2013, which has since been replaced by the industry wide Fast Food Award.
